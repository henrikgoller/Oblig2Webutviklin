<!--Our original intent for the website was to create a slideshow that showcased six different images with underlying text.
   This proved however to be a little bit more challenging than we expected. We did manage to create a simple slideshow, 
   but we could not manage to add text to it without having the text be part of the image.  Another reason why we did not 
   pursue this was that we could not manage to make it as interactive with a mobile device as we would have liked. We could
   not manage to make the buttons that change the slideshow good for a mobile device. So we decided to scrap the idea of a 
   slideshow and went with a scrollable page that changes depending on your screen size instead.  It was a tough decision 
   since we wanted to achieve our original idea, but we simply could not make it a reality.
   
   The change in direction simply did not go as planned, and we also had to follow the rules of our obligatory assignment. 
   One aspect that we had to learn was that the webpage should change depending on the different screen sizes.
   We used the @media rule to have different properties applied when the screen size was less than 600px.
   We based our website on a typical "summer blog" with colors and images that represent a typical summer for Scandinavian people.
   We also had to learn to implement different fonts than the default provided on Visual Studio Code.
   By going to the font site DaFont we found a few fonts that we felt best represented the way our website would look.
   To add the custom fonts to our website we used the @font-face rule to add custom fonts. 
   We would have liked to have achieved our original slideshow design,
   but we are still very pleased with how the final product turned out.
